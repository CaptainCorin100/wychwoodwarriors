<p>Well, not quite... Deep in the Forest of Wychwood, there remains one small band of warriors, forgotten by time, who still defend their hidden lair against the invaders.  Officially known as the Oxford University Historical Re-enactment Society, the Wychwood Warriors are dedicated to recreating aspects of Anglo-Saxon and Viking life in early medi&aelig;val England.</p>
